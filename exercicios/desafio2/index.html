            Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day <br>
            Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way <br>
            Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown <br>
            Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
        </p>

        <p>
            Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain <br>
            You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today <br>
            And then one day you find ten years have got behind you <br>
            No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="normal">
        <p>
            And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking <br>
            Racing around to come up behind you again <br>
            The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older <br>
            Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
        </p>
        <p>
            Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time <br>
            Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines <br>
            Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way <br>
            The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="img" id="img02">
        <p>
            Home, home again <br>
            I like to be here when I can <br>
            And when I come home cold and tired <br>
            It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
        </p>
    </section>

  
    <section class="normal">
            Far away across the field <br>
            The tolling of the iron bell <br>
            Calls the faithful to their knees <br>
            To hear the softly spoken magic spells
